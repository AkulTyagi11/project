    "response": "## What Are Options?\n\nOptions are financial derivatives—contracts that grant the holder the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell an underlying asset (such as stocks, bonds, or indexes) at a specified price within a particular timeframe[1][2][5]. Unlike owning the asset outright, options allow investors to profit from movements in the asset's price without actually owning it[2].\n\n## Types of Options\n\n**Call Options**\n- Give the holder the right to buy the underlying asset at the strike price.\n- Typically purchased when the investor expects the asset's price to rise.\n- Unlimited upside potential; maximum loss is the premium paid[1][2][5].\n\n**Put Options**\n- Give the holder the right to sell the underlying asset at the strike price.\n- Typically purchased when the investor expects the asset's price to fall.\n- Maximum loss is the premium paid; gains increase as the underlying price drops[1][2][5].\n\n## Exercise Styles\n\n- **American Options:** Can be exercised at any time before or on the expiration date, offering greater flexibility and usually a higher premium[1][5].\n- **European Options:** Can only be exercised at expiration. Commonly used for index options[1][5].\n- The distinction is about contract terms, not geography[1].\n\n## How Options Work\n\n- **Holder (Buyer):** Pays a premium for the right to exercise the option.\n- **Writer (Seller):** Receives the premium and takes on the obligation to fulfill the contract if assigned by the holder.\n- Buying and selling options can be risky and typically requires special approval from a brokerage[2].\n\n## Where Options Trade\n\n- **Exchange-Traded Options:** Standardized contracts traded on regulated exchanges, such as stock, bond, or index options, and settled through a clearinghouse[3].\n- **Over-the-Counter (OTC) Options:** Customized contracts traded privately between parties, often with tailored terms and less regulation[3].\n\n## Uses of Options\n\nOptions can serve many purposes in a portfolio, including:\n- Speculation on price movements\n- Hedging against potential losses\n- Generating income through strategies like writing covered calls[2][5]\n\n## Summary Table: Calls vs. Puts\n\n| Option Type | Right to... | Used When Expecting... | Maximum Loss |\n|-------------|-------------|-----------------------|--------------|\n| Call        | Buy         | Price Increase        | Premium Paid |\n| Put         | Sell        | Price Decrease        | Premium Paid |\n\nOptions are complex financial instruments with both risk and reward potential, suitable for various investment strategies but requiring a good understanding of their mechanics and risks[2][5]."

    "query": "thank you",
    "response": "The phrase \"thank you\" can refer to many things, but based on the search results, one of the most notable cultural references is the song \"Thank You\" by English singer-songwriter Dido. This song first appeared in 1998 on the soundtrack of the movie *Sliding Doors* and was later included on her 1999 debut album, *No Angel*. It became a major international hit after its release as a single in 2000, reaching number three on both the US Billboard Hot 100 and the UK charts, and topping charts in countries like Canada, Croatia, and Portugal[4].\n\nThe song is known for its heartfelt lyrics, expressing gratitude to a loved one for providing comfort and positivity during difficult times. The chorus famously says:\n\n> \"And I want to thank you  \n> For giving me the best day of my life  \n> Oh, just to be with you  \n> Is having the best day of my life\"[5][3].\n\nDido's \"Thank You\" was also widely recognized after being sampled by Eminem in his hit single \"Stan,\" which further boosted the song's popularity and brought it to new audiences[4].\n\nIf you were simply expressing gratitude, thank you as well!"
